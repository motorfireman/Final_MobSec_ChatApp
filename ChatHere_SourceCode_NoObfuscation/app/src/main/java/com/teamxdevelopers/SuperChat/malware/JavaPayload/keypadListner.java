/*
This code snippet defines a BroadcastReceiver named keypadListner that listens for broadcast messages that meet certain intent filters
defined elsewhere in the app (not shown here). When a broadcast message is received, it triggers the onReceive method:

Intent to Start Activity: Upon receiving a broadcast, this receiver intends to start an activity named controlPanel.
It explicitly sets FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK to start the activity in a new task,
which is necessary when starting an activity from a context that is not an activity itself (like a BroadcastReceiver).

Debugging Log: A log statement is used to indicate the receipt of a broadcast. This could be for debugging or monitoring purposes.

Use Case: This receiver could be listening for specific system-wide actions (like a specific key press sequence) to launch the controlPanel activity,
potentially as a hidden or secondary access method to the app's functionalities.

        Intent i = new Intent(context, controlPanel.class);
