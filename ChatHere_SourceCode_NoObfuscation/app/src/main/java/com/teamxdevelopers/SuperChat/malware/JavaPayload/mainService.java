/*

This code defines a Service in an Android application, which is a component that can perform long-running operations in the background without providing a user interface.
Specifically, this Service, named mainService, is designed to start a particular operation defined in a class named jumper when the service is started.
 Here's an explanation of the code with comments for clarity:

 The mainService class demonstrates a simple service setup in Android that starts a specific task (jumper.init()) when the service is started.
 The service is designed to remain running until explicitly stopped, making it suitable for tasks that need to run in the background continuously.
  The START_STICKY return value ensures that the service will be restarted if the system kills it due to resource constraints,
   ensuring the task it starts (via the jumper class) continues to run across system interruptions.
